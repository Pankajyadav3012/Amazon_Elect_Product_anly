# üì¶ Amazon Product Scraping & Analysis  

## üöÄ Overview  
This project automates the extraction of Amazon product data (specifically Electronics Product) using Selenium.  This scraped data is then cleaned and analyzed, with visualizations created in Power BI. This provides insights into product pricing, ratings, and specifications, enabling users to make informed decisions.

## üìÇ Project Structure  
- **`amazon_scraping_code.py`** ‚Äì This file is python script for web scraping Amazon product data using Selenium. It extracts essential details such as product names, prices, ratings, reviews, and specifications.
- **`amazon_products1_cleaned.csv`** ‚Äì  this is cleaned dataset ready for analysis, containing refined and structured data for easy visualization. 
- **`Cleaning_code.ipynb`** ‚Äì VScode for cleaning and preprocessing the scraped data, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. 
- **`amazon_dash_powerbi_.pbix`** ‚Äì This is Power BI dashboard for analyzing and visualizing the extracted data, with interactive charts and graphs showcasing trends and insights.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Python** (Selenium, Pandas) for data extraction & processing  
- **VSCODE** for cleaning and transformation  
- **Power BI** for visualization
